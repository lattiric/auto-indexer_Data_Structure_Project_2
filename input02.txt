Preface:

Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Implementation is a new
exciting text from Mustang Publishers aimed at upper division
undergraduate courses or introductory graduate courses.
<4>
Some of the topics covered are:
* Fast String Matching
* B+ Tree Implementation
* A* Graph Traversal
<10>
In a B+ Tree, the leaf nodes are connected as a doubly linked list.
<11>
Here is the part where I start to have some fun
with the analysis of all this stuff
Is my algorithm going to work?
And will the algorithm catch this?
Or am I doomed to get nothing over
a B+ on this project?
If this code is working right,
that B+ should not appear in the index.
There's an A* here too
This is doubly linked, but not a list.
<20>
There are 23 players on this sports team.
They each get 01 tries to get stuff right.
A refrigeration algorithm would be complicated.
But a B+ Tree would be nice.
<54>
Coq Au Vin is super delicious.
<55>
The Coq Au part means "cooked with."
The Vin part means wine.
It's not alcoholic, but amazing. I give it an A+.
Make a doubly linked list with all that.
Do you want to make an algorithm?
<56>
This is where I really test my algorithm.
